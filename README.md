# US vs China: Growth and Carbon Efficiency (1990–2019)

## Overview

This project analyzes economic growth and carbon efficiency in the United States and China between 1990 and 2019. The analysis focuses on GDP growth, CO2 emissions, carbon intensity, per capita measures, and efficiency convergence.

## Key Questions

- How did total GDP evolve in both countries?
- How did CO2 emissions change?
- Which country was more carbon efficient in 1990?
- Did carbon intensity decline over time?
- Were there periods of absolute decoupling?
- Is China converging toward US carbon efficiency levels?
- Which country generated more GDP per ton of CO2 on average?

## Main Findings

- China experienced significantly faster GDP growth.
- China reduced carbon intensity by about 69 percent, compared to about 50 percent for the United States.
- The carbon intensity gap narrowed substantially but did not disappear.
- The United States had more years of absolute decoupling.
- The United States generated over three times more GDP per ton of CO2 on average.
- US per capita emissions remained substantially higher.
